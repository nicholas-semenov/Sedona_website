# Sedona Website - README

## Overview

This website was my first project, created when I was 13 years old, while taking a course from HTML Academy. It is designed to introduce the beautiful city of Sedona, Arizona, with a focus on its attractions, accommodations, and more. The site includes an informational section, a photo and video gallery, a map of the state, and a list of recommended hotels. Additionally, there is a hotel booking form and a footer with links to social media.
